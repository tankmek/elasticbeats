# Elastic Beats
The default winlogbeat configuration file collects **all** endpoint logs from the various 
Microsoft Windows event channels. This repo contains an *optimized* version of the winlogbeat
configuration based on my research and includes recommendations from private and public sector
resources. You can find the specific resources listed in rhe references section of this document.

Please keep in mind that this is not a plug and play configuration. Use it as 
a *template* from which you can build a suitable configuration for your environment.

# Branches
This repo has a branch for version 7 and 8 of winlogbeat.
Select the appropriate branch for your environment and adjust it according
to your needs.
